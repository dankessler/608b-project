	abstract = {While statistical analysis of a single network has received a lot of attention in recent years, with a focus on social networks, analysis of a sample of networks presents its own challenges which require a different set of analytic tools. Here we study the problem of classification of networks with labeled nodes, motivated by applications in neuroimaging. Brain networks are constructed from imaging data to represent functional connectivity between regions of the brain, and previous work has shown the potential of such networks to distinguish between various brain disorders, giving rise to a network (or graph) classification problem. Existing approaches to graph classification tend to either treat all edge weights as a long vector, ignoring the network structure, or focus on the graph topology while ignoring the edge weights. Our goal here is to design a graph classification method that uses both the individual edge information and the network structure of the data in a computationally efficient way. We are also interested in obtaining a parsimonious and interpretable representation of differences in brain connectivity patterns between classes, which requires variable selection. We propose a graph classification method that uses edge weights as variables but incorporates the network nature of the data via penalties that promotes sparsity in the number of nodes. We implement the method via efficient convex optimization algorithms and show good performance on data from two {fMRI} studies of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The ability to volitionally regulate emotions is critical to health and well-being. While patterns of neural activation during emotion regulation have been well characterized, patterns of connectivity between regions remain less explored. It is increasingly recognized that the human brain is organized into large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}) whose interrelationships are altered in characteristic ways during psychological tasks. In this {fMRI} study of 54 healthy individuals, we investigated alterations in connectivity within and between {ICNs} produced by the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal. In order to gain a comprehensive picture of connectivity changes, we utilized connectomic psychophysiological interactions ({PPI}), a whole-brain generalization of standard single-seed {PPI} methods. In particular, we quantified {PPI} connectivity pair-wise across 837 {ROIs} placed throughout the cortex. We found that compared to maintaining one's emotional responses, engaging in reappraisal produced robust and distributed alterations in functional connections involving visual, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and default networks. Visual network in particular increased connectivity with multiple {ICNs} including dorsal attention and default networks. We interpret these findings in terms of the role of these networks in mediating critical constituent processes in emotion regulation, including visual processing, stimulus salience, attention control, and interpretation and contextualization of stimuli. Our results add a new network perspective to our understanding of the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation, and highlight that connectomic methods can play a valuable role in comprehensively investigating modulation of connectivity across task conditions.},

To investigate the potentially distributed effects of methylphenidate on the brain's intrinsic network architecture, we coupled resting state imaging with multivariate pattern classification. In a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, 32 healthy human volunteers received either methylphenidate or placebo prior to two {fMRI} resting state scans separated by approximately one week. Resting state connectomes were generated by placing regions of interest at regular intervals throughout the brain, and these connectomes were submitted for support vector machine analysis. We found that methylphenidate produces a distributed, reliably detected, multivariate neural signature. Methylphenidate effects were evident across multiple resting state networks, especially visual, somatomotor, and default networks. Methylphenidate reduced coupling within visual and somatomotor networks. In addition, default network exhibited decoupling with several task positive networks, consistent with methylphenidate modulation of the competitive relationship between these networks. These results suggest that connectivity changes within and between large-scale networks are potentially involved in the mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves attention functioning.},

Regulatory depletion is thought to play an important role in everyday problems (e.g., excessive spending, overeating) as well as psychiatric conditions, but its neurophysiological basis is poorly understood. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind design, we demonstrated that the psychostimulant methylphenidate (commonly known as Ritalin), a catecholamine reuptake blocker that increases dopamine and norepinephrine at the synaptic cleft, fully blocks effort-induced depletion of regulatory control. Spectral analysis of trial-by-trial reaction times revealed specificity of methylphenidate effects on regulatory depletion in the slow-4 frequency band. This band is associated with the operation of resting-state brain networks that produce mind wandering, which raises potential connections between our results and recent brain-network-based models of control over attention.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood, and there is great interest in understanding its neurobiological basis. A prominent neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that {ADHD} involves a lag in brain maturation. Previous work has found support for this hypothesis, but examinations have been limited to structural features of the brain (e.g., gray matter volume or cortical thickness). More recently, a growing body of work demonstrates that the brain is functionally organized into a number of large-scale networks, and the connections within and between these networks exhibit characteristic patterns of maturation. In this study, we investigated whether individuals with {ADHD} (age 7.2-21.8 y) exhibit a lag in maturation of the brain's developing functional architecture. Using connectomic methods applied to a large, multisite dataset of resting state scans, we quantified the effect of maturation and the effect of {ADHD} at more than 400,000 connections throughout the cortex. We found significant and specific maturational lag in connections within default mode network ({DMN}) and in {DMN} interconnections with two task positive networks ({TPNs}): frontoparietal network and ventral attention network. In particular, lag was observed within the midline core of the {DMN}, as well as in {DMN} connections with right lateralized prefrontal regions (in frontoparietal network) and anterior insula (in ventral attention network). Current models of the pathophysiology of attention dysfunction in {ADHD} emphasize altered {DMN}{TPN} interactions. Our finding of maturational lag specifically in connections within and between these networks suggests a developmental etiology for the deficits proposed in these models.},

	abstract = {Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders of childhood. Neuroimaging investigations of {ADHD} have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in {ADHD}. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default networkinvolved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attentionand task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in {ADHD} remain relatively rare.


Methods

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the {ADHD}-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis.


Results

{ADHD} brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [P?{\textless}?0.0001, false discovery rate ({FDR})-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (P?=?0.009, {FDR}-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections.


Conclusions

Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in {ADHD}. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in {ADHD}.

Participants were 3- to 5- year-old children recruited from the United States (N = 57) and Beijing, China (N = 60). Consistent with our hypothesis, U.S. children showed a significant negative relation between maternal-rated inhibitory control and both cortisol reactivity and recovery. However, this was not replicated in the Chinese sample. Children in China showed a significant positive relation between maternal-rated attentional focusing and cortisol reactivity that was not seen in the U.S. Results suggest that children who reside in Western and non-Western cultures have different predictors of their emotion-related stress response.},

To unite these modalities in a common model, we used joint independent component analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. Based on recent network models of {ADHD}, we hypothesized that altered relationships between large-scale networks, in particular, default mode network ({DMN}) and task-positive networks ({TPNs}), would co-occur with structural abnormalities in cognitive regulation regions. For 756 human participants in the {ADHD}-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression in {ADHD} versus healthy controls. Four components showed greater expression in {ADHD}. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed reduced {DMN}-{TPN} segregation co-occurring with structural abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, two important cognitive control regions. We also observed altered intranetwork connectivity in {DMN}, dorsal attention network, and visual network, with co-occurring distributed structural deficits. There was strong evidence of spatial correspondence across modalities: For all four components, the impact of the respective component on gray matter at a region strongly predicted the impact on functional connectivity at that region. Overall, our results demonstrate that {ADHD} involves multiple, cohesive modality spanning deficits, each one of which exhibits strong spatial overlap in the pattern of structural and functional alterations.},

	abstract = {Background

Recent studies suggest that mindfulness may be an effective component for posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) treatment. Mindfulness involves practice in volitional shifting of attention from ``mind wandering'' to present-moment attention to sensations, and cultivating acceptance. We examined potential neural correlates of mindfulness training using a novel group therapy (mindfulness-based exposure therapy ({MBET})) in combat veterans with {PTSD} deployed to Afghanistan ({OEF}) and/or Iraq ({OIF}).


Methods

Twenty-three male {OEF}/{OIF} combat veterans with {PTSD} were treated with a mindfulness-based intervention (N = 14) or an active control group therapy (present-centered group therapy ({PCGT}), N = 9). Pre-post therapy functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}, 3 T) examined resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) in default mode network ({DMN}) using posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) seeds, and salience network ({SN}) with anatomical amygdala seeds. {PTSD} symptoms were assessed at pre- and posttherapy with Clinician Administered {PTSD} Scale ({CAPS}).


Results

Patients treated with {MBET} had reduced {PTSD} symptoms (effect size d = 0.92) but effect was not significantly different from {PCGT} (d = 0.46). Increased {DMN} {rsFC} ({PCC} seed) with dorsolateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) regions and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) regions associated with executive control was seen following {MBET}. A group × time interaction found {MBET} showed increased connectivity with {DLPFC} and dorsal {ACC} following therapy; {PCC}{DLPFC} connectivity was correlated with improvement in {PTSD} avoidant and hyperarousal symptoms.


Conclusions

Increased connectivity between {DMN} and executive control regions following mindfulness training could underlie increased capacity for volitional shifting of attention. The increased {PCC}{DLPFC} {rsFC} following {MBET} was related to {PTSD} symptom improvement, pointing to a potential therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness-based therapies.},

Intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), important units of brain functional organization, demonstrate substantial maturation during youth. In addition, interrelationships between {ICNs} have been reliably implicated in attention performance. It is unknown whether alterations in {ICN} maturational profiles can reliably detect impaired attention functioning in youth.Objective
To use a network growth charting approach to investigate the association between alterations in {ICN} maturation and attention performance.Design, Setting, and Participants
Data were obtained from the publicly available Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, a prospective, population-based sample of 9498 youths who underwent genomic testing, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging. Data collection was conducted at an academic and children's hospital health care network between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2011, and data analysis was conducted between February 1, 2015, and January 15, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures
Statistical associations between deviations from normative network growth were assessed as well as 2 main outcome measures: accuracy during the Penn Continuous Performance Test and diagnosis with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Results
Of the 9498 individuals identified, 1000 youths aged 8 to 22 years underwent brain imaging. A sample of 519 youths who met quality control criteria entered analysis, of whom 25 (4.8\%) met criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The mean ({SD}) age of the youth was 15.7 (3.1) years, and 223 (43.0\%) were male. Participants' patterns of deviations from normative maturational trajectories were indicative of sustained attention functioning (R2?=?24\%; F6,512?=?26.89; P?{\textless}?2.2?×?10-16). Moreover, these patterns were found to be a reliable biomarker of severe attention impairment (peak receiver operating characteristic curve measured by area under the curve, 79.3\%). In particular, a down-shifted pattern of {ICN} maturation (shallow maturation), rather than a right-shifted pattern (lagged maturation), was implicated in reduced attention performance (Akaike information criterion relative likelihood, 3.22?×?1026). Finally, parallel associations between {ICN} dysmaturation and diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were identified.Conclusions and Relevance
Growth charting methods are widely used to assess the development of physical or other biometric characteristics, such as weight and head circumference. To date, this is the first demonstration that this method can be extended to development of functional brain networks to identify clinically relevant conditions, such as dysfunction of sustained attention.},

In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome (defined by pairs of points in 3-D space) is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the {GraphNet} regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or {GraphNet} regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine ({SVM}) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and {GraphNet} regularized {SVM} with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D ``connectome space,'' offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes.},

Although evidence is ambiguous, behavioural studies have repeatedly suggested that control-demanding tasks seem to deplete a limited cache of self-regulatory resources leading to performance degradations and fatigue. While resource depletion has indirectly been associated with a decline in right prefrontal cortex capacity, its precise neural underpinnings have not yet been revealed. This study consisted of two independent experiments, which set out to investigate the causal role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) in a classic dual phase depletion paradigm employing non-invasive brain stimulation. In Experiment 1 we demonstrated a general depletion effect, which was significantly eliminated by anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the right {DLPFC}. In Experiment 2, however, we failed to replicate the basic psychological depletion effect within a second independent sample. The dissimilar results are discussed in the context of the current replication crisis' and suggestions for future studies are offered. While our current results do not allow us to firmly argue for or against the existence of resource depletion, we outline why it is crucial to further clarify which specific external and internal circumstances lead to limited replicability of the described effect. We showcase and discuss the current inter-lab replication problem based on two independent samples tested within one research group (intra-lab).},

Mothers reported on psychological control. Children's cortisol was collected during a stressor and two indices of Area Under the Curve ({AUC}) were computed: {AUCg} which accounts for total output, and {AUCi}, which captures reactivity. Results indicate that Chinese mothers reported higher levels of psychological control and Chinese children had higher levels of {AUCg} than their American counterparts. Across both cultures, psychological control was significantly associated with increased cortisol levels as indexed by {AUCg}. There were no associations for {AUCi}.

	abstract = {Purpose
We combined a large longitudinal neuroimaging dataset that includes children who do and do not stutter and a whole-brain network analysis in order to examine the intra- and inter-network connectivity changes associated with stuttering. Additionally, we asked whether whole brain connectivity patterns observed at the initial year of scanning could predict persistent stuttering in later years.
Methods
A total of 224 high-quality resting state {fMRI} scans collected from 84 children (42 stuttering, 42 controls) were entered into an independent component analysis ({ICA}), yielding a number of distinct network connectivity maps (``components'') as well as expression scores for each component that quantified the degree to which it is expressed for each child. These expression scores were compared between stuttering and control groups' first scans. In a second analysis, we examined whether the components that were most predictive of stuttering status also predicted persistence in stuttering.
Results
Stuttering status, as well as stuttering persistence, were associated with aberrant network connectivity involving the default mode network and its connectivity with attention, somatomotor, and frontoparietal networks. The results suggest developmental alterations in the balance of integration and segregation of large-scale neural networks that support proficient task performance including fluent speech motor control.
Conclusions
This study supports the view that stuttering is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder and provides comprehensive brain network maps that substantiate past theories emphasizing the importance of considering situational, emotional, attentional and linguistic factors in explaining the basis for stuttering onset, persistence, and recovery.},

	abstract = {While statistical analysis of a single network has received a lot of attention in recent years, with a focus on social networks, analysis of a sample of networks presents its own challenges which require a different set of analytic tools. Here we study the problem of classification of networks with labeled nodes, motivated by applications in neuroimaging. Brain networks are constructed from imaging data to represent functional connectivity between regions of the brain, and previous work has shown the potential of such networks to distinguish between various brain disorders, giving rise to a network (or graph) classification problem. Existing approaches to graph classification tend to either treat all edge weights as a long vector, ignoring the network structure, or focus on the graph topology while ignoring the edge weights. Our goal here is to design a graph classification method that uses both the individual edge information and the network structure of the data in a computationally efficient way. We are also interested in obtaining a parsimonious and interpretable representation of differences in brain connectivity patterns between classes, which requires variable selection. We propose a graph classification method that uses edge weights as variables but incorporates the network nature of the data via penalties that promotes sparsity in the number of nodes. We implement the method via efficient convex optimization algorithms and show good performance on data from two {fMRI} studies of schizophrenia.},

It is an open question, however, whether connectomes differ across individuals in a correspondingly massive number of ways, or whether most differences take a small number of characteristic forms. We systematically investigated this question and found clear evidence of low-rank structure in which a modest number of connectomic components, around 50-150, account for a sizable portion of inter-individual connectomic variation. This number was convergently arrived at with multiple methods including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and assessment of reconstruction of out-of-sample data. We demonstrate that these connectomic components enable prediction of a broad array of neurocognitive and clinical variables. In addition, using stochastic block modeling-based methods, we show these components exhibit extensive community structure reflecting interrelationships between intrinsic connectivity networks. We propose that these connectivity components form an effective basis set for quantifying and interpreting inter-individual connectomic differences, and for predicting behavioral/clinical phenotypes.},

This presents a critical opportunity for psychiatry, as it is clear that many psychiatric disorders ({ADHD}, autism, schizophrenia) are fundamentally disorders of neurodevelopment. Concurrently, there has been a paradigmatic shift in psychiatric imaging away from locationist approaches that aim to identify the spatial locus of dysfunction towards connectivist approaches that aim to understand the brain as a complex and coordinated network. In this talk, I present an emerging framework for characterizing and quantifying neurodevelopmental disturbances in the functional connectome. I focus on work from our group and others that characterizes normative developmental trajectories of the functional connectome and links dysmaturation to deleterious outcomes.},

	abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis regulates cortisol response to stress and its circadian pattern (Lopez 2004). Both {HPA} functions have been of interest to developmental researchers who wish to understand the biological underpinnings of emotion regulation. The circadian pattern of cortisol is initially established in infancy. However, it matures into the preschool years becoming more reliable by age 4 (Watamura 2004). Variations in the circadian cortisol pattern have been observed in older children and adolescents with mental health concerns (Pajer 2001, {McBurnett} 2000, Cicchetti 2001, Heim 2000).  In addition, altered circadian cortisol patterns have been observed in younger at-risk children in foster care, with blunted patterns at preschool age (Dozier 2006). Blunted patterns may result from lower morning or elevated evening levels or both.  Few studies have investigated relationships between circadian cortisol patterns and aspects of emotion regulation in normative populations of young children and fewer have examined cultural differences in such relationships.
As part of a larger study of emotion regulation in preschool-age children, 110 subjects were enrolled across two urban sites in the {US} and China. Saliva was collected within 45 minutes of awakening and bedtime over the course of three days for measurement of cortisol. Average cortisol concentrations and standard deviation across three days were computed separately for morning and evening samples. Differences between {AM}/{PM} pairs were summed across the three days. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist ({CBCL}) (Achenbach, 1997) and the Child Mood Survey ({CMS}, based on the Mood Survey Questionnaire, Froming 1980).  {CBCL} internalizing and externalizing scales, {CMS} mood level and reactivity scales and three {CMS} items were included: Valence (how happy the child is); Emotional Lability (how frequently the child's mood changes), Reactive Intensity (how intensely the child reacts).  Differences by culture were examined with one-way {ANOVA}; relationships between variables within culture were examined with bivariate correlations.  
Chinese participants had higher morning cortisol concentrations and greater variability in their evening samples than {US} subjects. Evening cortisol concentrations and morning variability did not differ by culture.   
Chinese mothers reported greater child lability and intensity than {US} parents. {CMS} reactivity and mood level scales were both higher for Chinese children. Chinese mothers also reported higher scores for {CBCL} internalizing and externalizing scales. Mother report of child valence did not differ by culture.
Emotional lability was related to morning cortisol variability and evening cortisol concentrations in China and to morning cortisol concentration and evening cortisol variability in the {US}. Reactive intensity was related to both morning cortisol concentrations and variability in China, but not in the {US}.  Additionally, {CMS} reactivity scale was related to morning cortisol concentrations in China but not in the {US}. There were no associations between cortisol measures and valence, {CMS} level scale and {CBCL} internalizing or externalizing scales.
The lack of association between cortisol measures and mood level is notable given their relationships to emotional reactivity measures in this normative preschool-age sample. Further research is necessary to understand the relationships between cortisol level and variability and mood in young children and the role of culture in these relationships.},

	title = {Dynamic Demonstration of Early Language Understanding in Chinese- and English-learning Infants},
	url = {www.icdl09.org},
	abstract = {Background: Children's language learning is often measured using discrete, single outcome measures that collapse time-series data into a single measurement, potentially missing patterns evident only through time. Our data suggests that demonstrations of linguistic knowledge vary not only across languages, word class (noun/verb), and morphological frame (e.g. kick vs kicking), but also across micro-units of time as evidenced through online, dynamic looking times.

Procedure: Young children's comprehension of familiar words was examined through a paradigm based on the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm ({IPLP}). Children were familiarized to an actor character, ``Po,'' in an initial play session, and then participated in the testing session. Dynamic scenes, depicting ``Po'' performing an action on an object, were presented with a simultaneous audio stimulus, matching either the action or the object. The audio was either presented with or without morphological inflections (e.g., kissing vs. kiss). The dynamic scene was then split into two scenes depicted at either side of the presentation monitor. In one scene, the object was the same but the action was different, and in the other the action was the same but the object was different. The same audio as before was played. The side where the audio matched the scene was designated ``Target'' and the side where the audio did not match was called ``Non-Target.'' This was repeated for four different possible action-object pairings. The two broken up scenes were presented without audio at the beginning of the trial to allow for evaluation of differential salience of the two depictions. All presentations were interceded by a simple attention getter that drew the child's attention to the center of the presentation monitor.

Participants: 12, 15, 18, and 24 month old infants learning English or Chinese were tested in Ann Arbor, {MI}, {USA}, or Beijing, China.

Measures: Infant-caregivers reported in advance whether their child could understand or say any of the words used in the audio. Participants were videotaped during the {IPLP} session and their directional looking (left, center, right, away) was coded for each frame of video.

Analysis: Participants were grouped according to language, morphological frame, and then subdivided based on either age or knowledge of a given word. We were interested in visualizing the patterns of target versus non-target looking over time to explore differences in the patterns resulting from effects of and interactions between age, word knowledge, target word type, language, and morphological frame. For each child, each frame of each test trial was scored as either 1 (target-looking) or 0 (not target-looking). Children's trials were converted to a word-onset locked millisecond timeline and concatenated into analytical subgroups by averaging. The result is a number from 0 to 1 that represents the proportion of children within a given group looking at the target side for each frame. This proportion is plotted against time for visual inspection.

Results: The resulting data visualization highlights the discovery of an interplay between language, morphological frame, word knowledge, and class. For example, for the target word ``Bottle,'' in the English Bare condition, children who can say the word do not demonstrate greater understanding (as would be evidenced by a higher proportion of target-looking early in the trial), but a benefit appears with a morphological frame (``a bottle'') whereby a higher proportion of children who can say the word look at the target side early in the trial relative to children who are not reported to say the word. In Mandarin, despite receiving a bare morphological frame, participants with productive knowledge of the word have a clear advantage similar to the English Morph condition. Despite these differences, parent report of ``bottle'' production does not differ by language (English=18/45; Chinese=8/23).

Conclusion: Our analysis suggests a complex interplay between morphological frame, language, word class (noun/verb), and word knowledge in the patterns of demonstration of word knowledge.},

	abstract = {Abstract: This research demonstrates that Chinese and American preschoolers show similar salivary cortisol response patterns to challenging emotional tasks. Factors such as parent and child baseline salivary cortisol levels and maternal report of child emotional reactivity do not differ across cultures. 
Supporting Summary: Background: there has been little research examining the cross-cultural differences of preschoolers' behavioral and physiological responses to challenging emotional situations. This study is part of a larger research project on the development of emotion regulation in four-year-olds in China, Japan, and the United States. Our data investigates cross-cultural differences in salivary cortisol responses to disappointing and frustrating tasks among preschoolers in the United States and China. Additionally, these data examine maternal report of child emotional reactivity and the relationship between maternal report and child salivary cortisol levels. 
Design: participants were 25 four-year-olds from China (China, n=12) and the United States ({US}, n=13). The study was conducted at each child's preschool for three consecutive days in two hour blocks. Saliva was collected at the start of each session and was followed by a 30-minute calming activity. After the calming activity, saliva was collected immediately prior to a challenging emotional activity and subsequently in 10-minute intervals for the remaining 90 minutes. The challenging tasks were a control task (day 1), a frustrating task, and a disappointing task (counterbalanced on days 2-3). Prior to the start of the study, mothers completed a child version of the Mood Survey questionnaire (Froming \& Underwood, 1980) and the Child Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart, 1989). In addition, parent and child saliva was collected at home in the morning and evening of each day of the study. 
Analysis: salivary cortisol concentrations were determined by {ELISA}. Pearson correlations and {ANOVA} tests were used to explore similarities and differences across the cultures. Specifically, we examined the relationship between salivary cortisol reactivity and maternal report of emotional reactivity. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between parent cortisol baseline levels and child cortisol reactivity. Salivary cortisol reactivity was determined by averaging individual differences between peak and baseline cortisol levels. This average was then split across the mean for each culture. Children whose average difference between peak and baseline cortisol levels (across three days of testing) was greater than the corresponding cultural mean were classified as highly responsive. Emotional reactivity was determined by using scores on the anger and frustration subscale on the {CBQ} and the reactivity subscale on the child Mood Survey. 
Results: mean cortisol level differed across each culture (C=.051 nmol/L; {US}=.018 nmol/L). It should be noted that Chinese children had, on average, higher morning cortisol levels than {US} children. Based on the separate reactivity categorization (high/low) by culture, {ANOVA} tests revealed that there were no significant differences in reactivity across the two cultures. In addition, maternal report of child emotional reactivity was not related to child reactivity as measured by changes in salivary cortisol levels. There were no significant differences in maternal report of child emotional reactivity across cultures. Also, parent morning and evening cortisol levels were not related to child cortisol response during the testing period across cultures. 
Conclusion: there were no significant cross-cultural differences in measures of behavioral and physiological response to challenging emotional situations. This suggests that child emotionality across cultures is more similar than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopment disorder with extensive evidence of neural disconnection. In order to further characterize connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia, we applied a novel whole-brain connectomic approach to 145 resting state scans from the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence sample.
Methods: 71 patients with schizophrenia ({SZ}) and 74 healthy controls ({HC}) underwent 6-minute resting scans. After standard pre-processing, 1166 {ROIs} were placed at 12mm intervals across the brain, and cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced. These were thresholded and overlaid on the Yeo (2012) network parcellation of the resting brain to implicate seven major resting state networks, and five additional subcortical regions (see Figure). Cross-tabulations between networks were compared to a null distribution with difference of proportion Z-tests in order to identify deviant intra- and inter-network connectivity in {SZ} versus {HC}. Motion regressors at the first and second-levels quantified and minimized motion effects.
Results: {SZ} brains exhibited diffuse hypoconnectivity within the default network (Z=4.01, p{\textless}0.001), and between hippocampus/parahippocampus and default and attention networks (Z=7.06, p{\textless}0.001). Hyperconnectivity was observed within frontoparietal networks (Z=3.41, p{\textless}0.001), and between other task-positive networks, including dorsal attention, ventral attention, and somatomotor network (ps{\textless}0.001; see Figure).
Conclusions: Using novel, whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide evidence of robust, distributed connectivity abnormalities in default, attention, and limbic networks in schizophrenia that could potentially serve as reliable biomarkers of disease.},

	abstract = {Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant medication that reliably produces acute improvements in attention functioning. Recent models of attention focus on interconnectivity between large-scale networks, especially default network and task positive networks. However, the effects of methylphenidate in altering network connectivity patterns are poorly understood. We conducted a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study, in which 32 healthy volunteers received either methylphenidate or placebo prior to two {fMRI} scans separated by approximately one week. We report the results of three analyses of data generated from this study. Analysis 1 used paired support-vector machines, a multivariate classification method for within-subject data developed by our group, applied to resting state scans. We demonstrate methylphenidate produces a reliably detected multivariate neurosignature. In particular, methylphenidate generates altered default network-task positive network coupling, and altered connectivity within visual and somatomotor networks. Analysis 2 used network contingency analysis, a novel connectomic analysis method developed by our group, to identify network relationship patterns that predict across session changes in reaction time variability. Analysis 3 introduces dynamic connectivity, a new method for investigating changes in network coupling patterns over short time intervals (e.g., 15-60 seconds) within a scanning session. We demonstrate that changes in dynamic connectivity between large-scale networks predict changes in reaction time variability across short temporal epochs within a single scan.},

	title = {Modality-spanning lag in maturation in {ADHD}},
	abstract = {Background: A prominent neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that {ADHD} involves a lag in brain maturation. In order to investigate this hypothesis simultaneously across both brain structure and function, we used joint independent components analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. We hypothesized that components associated with large-scale networks [in particular default mode network ({DMN}) and task positive network ({TPNs})] and regions involved in cognitive and motoric regulation would exhibit both strong maturational effects and strong opposing {ADHD} effects.

Methods: For 421 participants from the {ADHD}-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes derived from 1166 regions of interest throughout the brain. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression as a function of disease and age.

Results: Two components significantly showed the predicted pattern of age effects that were lagged in individuals with {ADHD}. The first component showed (with increasing age) increased 1) intra {DMN} integration; 2) increased segregation between {DMN} and dorsal and ventral attention networks (two {TPNs}); and 3) increased gray matter volume in {TPN} regions responsible for regulatory control and decreases in striatal regions. The second had diffuse connectomic alterations and gray matter changes similar to the first. 

Conclusions: We observed modality-spanning maturational lag in {ADHD}, specifically in the development of {DMN} interrelationships with attention networks. Our findings may shed light on the developmental etiology of {ADHD}.},

({SVM}) that uses resting state functional connectomes ({FCs}) as the fea-
tures for predicting diagnostic labels. Speci?cally, we employ a penalty
that accounts for the following two-way structure that exists in a mul-
tisite {FC} dataset: (1) the 6-D spatial structure in the {FCs} captured via
either the {GraphNet}, fused Lasso, or the isotropic total variation penalty,
and (2) the inter-site structure captured via the multitask ` 1 ` 2 -penalty.
To solve the resulting high dimensional optimization problem, we intro-
duce an extension to a recently proposed algorithm based on the alter-
nating direction method. The potential utility of the proposed method
is demonstrated on the multisite {ADHD}-200 dataset.},

	title = {Aberrant connectomic architecture of the resting brain in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Analysis of the {ADHD}-200 multisite sample},
	abstract = {Background  
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a serious and prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging investigations of {ADHD} have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions associated with motor inhibition and cognitive control. Recent years have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in {ADHD}, with current work focusing on abnormal relationships between default network and task positive attention networks. In order to comprehensively characterize connectivity abnormalities in {ADHD} across the whole brain, we applied network contingency analysis, a novel connectomic approach developed by our group, to the {ADHD}-200 multisite sample.

Methods: 632 participants (419 {HC}, 212 {ADHD}) from seven contributing sites underwent resting state scanning. Quality checking removed outliers and subjects with excessive motion, leaving 421 participants to enter analysis (288 {HC}, mean age 12.8; 133 {ADHD}; mean age 12.0). After standard pre-processing, 1166 {ROIs} were placed at 12mm intervals across the brain, and cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced for each subject. {ADHD} and {HC} connectomes were subtracted producing a difference map, with model covariates controlling for the effects of scanner/site, age, {IQ}, handedness, and head motion. For seven major connectivity networks identified in the Yeo (2012) parcellation, deviant intra- and inter-network connectivity was identified with non-parametric permutation tests, with {FDR}-correction applied to account for multiple comparisons.

Results 
{ADHD} brains exhibited diffuse hypoconnectivity within the default network ({FDR} q=0.03). In addition, default network exhibited aberrant connectivity with two task positive networksfrontoparietal network (q=0.008) and ventral attention network (q{\textless}0.001)as well as visual network (q=0.04). Significant right lateralization was observed in abnormal connections within default network (p{\textless}0.001; Bernoulli test), and default network connections with task positive and visual networks (all ps {\textless}0.01).

Conclusion  
Using novel whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide evidence of robust, distributed connectivity abnormalities in {ADHD}. Consistent with current models, prominent disturbances were identified in connections within default network and between default network and task-positive networks. Right lateralization of default network abnormalities in {ADHD} was an unexpected finding, but is consistent with emerging evidence of right-brain dominance in visuospatial attention. Distributed abnormalities in the {ADHD} resting state connectome could potentially serve as a brain-based biomarker of the disease.},

	title = {Growth Charting of Brain Connectivity Networks and the Identification of Attention Impairment in Youth},
	abstract = {Background
Growth charts of physical characteristics (e.g., pediatric growth charts of height \& head circumference) have long been used for early identification of somatic abnormalities. In the present study, we developed growth charts for maturing functional brain networks in order to identify clinically-relevant neurocognitive abnormalities, in particular impairments in attention functioning. The human brain is organized into a number of interconnected units called intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), and {ICNs} exhibit extensive development and differentiation during youth. In addition, {ICNs} are also implicated in attention performance. These observations raise an intriguing hypothesis: Deviations from neurotypical patterns of network maturation, calculated by means of network growth charts, could reliably predict the early emergence of sustained attention impairment. This study is, as far as we know, the first to investigate this hypothesis. 


Methods
Resting state functional neuroimaging scans were obtained for 519 youth, age 8-22. These scans were used to produce comprehensive maps of functional connectivity across the whole brain (``functional connectomes''). All participants also performed the Penn Continuous Performance Test, which evaluates sustained attention functioning. Using a multivariate statistical method (joint independent component analyses) we produced growth charts that represent neurotypical patterns of maturation for major brain networks. ``Underdevelopment scores'' were then calculated reflecting each participant's deviations from neurotypical growth. These scores were used to predict attention dysfunction (as measured by the Penn Continuous Performance Task).

Results
Several key networks showed evidence of robust maturation including default mode network and several task-positive networks, which have previously been implicated in attention functioning. After constructing growth charts for these networks, we found that underdevelopment scores (i.e., scores reflecting underdevelopment of networks relative to age) predicted a remarkable 28.7\% of the variance across participants in attention functioning (F(15,503) = 13.48, p {\textless} 2.2 * 10{\textasciicircum}(-16))). Moreover, they served as a reliable biomarker of severe attention impairment (79.3\% prediction accuracy). 

Conclusions
This study introduces a novel brain network growth charting method which we used to produce a highly sensitive brain-based biomarker of attention dysfunction. Growth charting of functional brain networks could provide a new approach for constructing neuroimaging biomarkers for other psychiatrically relevant conditions. Extensions of this methodology for biomarker construction for psychosis- and autism-spectrum traits are underway.




Using this technique, we showed children who perform substantially worse in objective tests of attention performance are underedeveloped with respect to key brain networks implicated in attention functioning perform substantially worse in objective tests of attention performance. produced a highly sensitive brain-based biomarker of attention dysfunction by growth charting brain networks implicated in both developmental and attention literature. We believe this approach holds great promise for biomarker discovery in other developmentally emergent cognitive domains.},

In a particularly influential paper, Cody Ross used a multi-level Bayesian approach, implemented in the popular Bayesian modeling framework Stan, to arrive at both national- and county-level estimates. His work also explores the role of a number of regionally varying covariates in predicting relative risks.

Dan and his colleagues became interested in the work, and thanks to the code and data for the paper being publicly available, were able to first reproduce many of the key results, and then replicate several using an independent dataset covering another time period collected by the Washington Post.

They're currently extending the approach to better capture instances of persistent racial disparity in police shooting to highlight potential regional targets for further study (both troubling cases and "success stories").

Abstract:
Background:
Attention functioning rapidly matures in childhood and adolescence. Intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), convergently implicated in attentional processing, also demonstrate massive maturation during this time. We applied joint independent component analysis ({jICA}), a powerful multivariate method, to a large youth sample to test the hypothesis that {ICN} organization explains developmental improvement in attention functioning and individual differences in task performance.
Methods:
Participants (n=671, ages 8.6-22.6) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort completed the Penn Continuous Performance Task and 6.2-minute resting state scans. Cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced from 1068 {ROIs} and submitted to {jICA}. The resulting connectomic components were tested for differential expression as a function of age and task accuracy. Motion effects were controlled with scrubbing and first- and second-level motion regression.
Results:
Expression of the fifteen connectomic components accounted for a remarkable 33\% of the variance in task performance (F(15,655)=21.52; p=2.2x10{\textasciicircum}-16). Further probing showed that six components that exhibited highly statistically significant maturational effects (all p's{\textless}0.01, {FDR}-corrected) by themselves accounted for most of the predictive power (27\% of variance in task performance), and continued to significantly predict task performance even after controlling for chronological age (F(6,662)=12.7, p=1.2x10{\textasciicircum}-13). These six components implicate connectomic alterations within the default mode network ({DMN}), within the frontoparietal network ({FPN}), and between the {DMN} and two task positive networks, the Ventral Attention Network and Dorsal Attention Network. 
Conclusions:
Using whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide first-time evidence that maturation of the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is a robust predictor of attention performance. These results suggest that dysmaturation of {ICNs} could serve as a biomarker of attention dysfunction.},

By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times.

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the {LARS} algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the {LARS} algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

	abstract = {Specify a randomized algorithm that, given a very large graph or network, extracts a random subgraph. What can we learn about the input graph from a single subsample? We derive laws of large numbers for the sampler output, by relating randomized subsampling to distributional invariance: Assuming an invariance holds is tantamount to assuming the sample has been generated by a specific algorithm. That in turn yields a notion of ergodicity. Sampling algorithms induce model classes---graphon models, sparse generalizations of exchangeable graphs, and random multigraphs with exchangeable edges can all be obtained in this manner, and we specialize our results to a number of examples. One class of sampling algorithms emerges as special: Roughly speaking, those defined as limits of random transformations drawn uniformly from certain sequences of groups. Some known pathologies of network models based on graphons are explained as a form of selection bias.},

Real-world complex systems may be mathematically modeled as graphs, revealing properties of the system. Here we study graphs of functional brain organization in healthy adults using resting state functional connectivity {MRI}. We propose two novel brain-wide graphs, one of 264 putative functional areas, the other a modification of voxelwise networks that eliminates potentially artificial short-distance relationships. These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a processing system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.

	abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for solving a variety of convex cone problems that frequently arise in signal processing, machine learning, statistics, and other ?elds. The approach works as follows: ?rst, determine a conic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply smoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal ?rst-order method. A merit of this approach is its ?exibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems can be solved via this approach. These include models with objective functionals such as the total-variation norm, W x 1 where W is arbitrary, or a combination thereof. In addition, the paper also introduces a number of technical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme, a novel approach for controlling the step size, and some new results showing that the smooth and unsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our framework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally e?cient algorithms. For instance, our general implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for solving intensively studied problems such as the {LASSO}. Further, numerical experiments show that one can solve the Dantzig selector problem, for which no e?cient large-scale solvers exist, in a few hundred iterations. Finally, the paper is accompanied with a software release. This software is not a single, monolithic solver; rather, it is a suite of programs and routines designed to serve as building blocks for constructing complete algorithms.},

	abstract = {While statistical analysis of a single network has received a lot of attention in recent years, with a focus on social networks, analysis of a sample of networks presents its own challenges which require a different set of analytic tools. Here we study the problem of classification of networks with labeled nodes, motivated by applications in neuroimaging. Brain networks are constructed from imaging data to represent functional connectivity between regions of the brain, and previous work has shown the potential of such networks to distinguish between various brain disorders, giving rise to a network (or graph) classification problem. Existing approaches to graph classification tend to either treat all edge weights as a long vector, ignoring the network structure, or focus on the graph topology while ignoring the edge weights. Our goal here is to design a graph classification method that uses both the individual edge information and the network structure of the data in a computationally efficient way. We are also interested in obtaining a parsimonious and interpretable representation of differences in brain connectivity patterns between classes, which requires variable selection. We propose a graph classification method that uses edge weights as variables but incorporates the network nature of the data via penalties that promotes sparsity in the number of nodes. We implement the method via efficient convex optimization algorithms and show good performance on data from two {fMRI} studies of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The ability to volitionally regulate emotions is critical to health and well-being. While patterns of neural activation during emotion regulation have been well characterized, patterns of connectivity between regions remain less explored. It is increasingly recognized that the human brain is organized into large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}) whose interrelationships are altered in characteristic ways during psychological tasks. In this {fMRI} study of 54 healthy individuals, we investigated alterations in connectivity within and between {ICNs} produced by the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal. In order to gain a comprehensive picture of connectivity changes, we utilized connectomic psychophysiological interactions ({PPI}), a whole-brain generalization of standard single-seed {PPI} methods. In particular, we quantified {PPI} connectivity pair-wise across 837 {ROIs} placed throughout the cortex. We found that compared to maintaining one's emotional responses, engaging in reappraisal produced robust and distributed alterations in functional connections involving visual, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and default networks. Visual network in particular increased connectivity with multiple {ICNs} including dorsal attention and default networks. We interpret these findings in terms of the role of these networks in mediating critical constituent processes in emotion regulation, including visual processing, stimulus salience, attention control, and interpretation and contextualization of stimuli. Our results add a new network perspective to our understanding of the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation, and highlight that connectomic methods can play a valuable role in comprehensively investigating modulation of connectivity across task conditions.},

In a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, 32 healthy human volunteers received either methylphenidate or placebo prior to two {fMRI} resting state scans separated by approximately one week. Resting state connectomes were generated by placing regions of interest at regular intervals throughout the brain, and these connectomes were submitted for support vector machine analysis. We found that methylphenidate produces a distributed, reliably detected, multivariate neural signature. Methylphenidate effects were evident across multiple resting state networks, especially visual, somatomotor, and default networks. Methylphenidate reduced coupling within visual and somatomotor networks. In addition, default network exhibited decoupling with several task positive networks, consistent with methylphenidate modulation of the competitive relationship between these networks. These results suggest that connectivity changes within and between large-scale networks are potentially involved in the mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves attention functioning.},

Regulatory depletion is thought to play an important role in everyday problems (e.g., excessive spending, overeating) as well as psychiatric conditions, but its neurophysiological basis is poorly understood. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind design, we demonstrated that the psychostimulant methylphenidate (commonly known as Ritalin), a catecholamine reuptake blocker that increases dopamine and norepinephrine at the synaptic cleft, fully blocks effort-induced depletion of regulatory control. Spectral analysis of trial-by-trial reaction times revealed specificity of methylphenidate effects on regulatory depletion in the slow-4 frequency band. This band is associated with the operation of resting-state brain networks that produce mind wandering, which raises potential connections between our results and recent brain-network-based models of control over attention.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood, and there is great interest in understanding its neurobiological basis. A prominent neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that {ADHD} involves a lag in brain maturation. Previous work has found support for this hypothesis, but examinations have been limited to structural features of the brain (e.g., gray matter volume or cortical thickness). More recently, a growing body of work demonstrates that the brain is functionally organized into a number of large-scale networks, and the connections within and between these networks exhibit characteristic patterns of maturation. In this study, we investigated whether individuals with {ADHD} (age 7.2-21.8 y) exhibit a lag in maturation of the brain's developing functional architecture. Using connectomic methods applied to a large, multisite dataset of resting state scans, we quantified the effect of maturation and the effect of {ADHD} at more than 400,000 connections throughout the cortex. We found significant and specific maturational lag in connections within default mode network ({DMN}) and in {DMN} interconnections with two task positive networks ({TPNs}): frontoparietal network and ventral attention network. In particular, lag was observed within the midline core of the {DMN}, as well as in {DMN} connections with right lateralized prefrontal regions (in frontoparietal network) and anterior insula (in ventral attention network). Current models of the pathophysiology of attention dysfunction in {ADHD} emphasize altered {DMN}{TPN} interactions. Our finding of maturational lag specifically in connections within and between these networks suggests a developmental etiology for the deficits proposed in these models.},

	abstract = {Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders of childhood. Neuroimaging investigations of {ADHD} have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in {ADHD}. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default networkinvolved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attentionand task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in {ADHD} remain relatively rare.


Methods

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the {ADHD}-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis.


Results

{ADHD} brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [P?{\textless}?0.0001, false discovery rate ({FDR})-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (P?=?0.009, {FDR}-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections.


Conclusions

Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in {ADHD}. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in {ADHD}.

To unite these modalities in a common model, we used joint independent component analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. Based on recent network models of {ADHD}, we hypothesized that altered relationships between large-scale networks, in particular, default mode network ({DMN}) and task-positive networks ({TPNs}), would co-occur with structural abnormalities in cognitive regulation regions. For 756 human participants in the {ADHD}-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression in {ADHD} versus healthy controls. Four components showed greater expression in {ADHD}. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed reduced {DMN}-{TPN} segregation co-occurring with structural abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, two important cognitive control regions. We also observed altered intranetwork connectivity in {DMN}, dorsal attention network, and visual network, with co-occurring distributed structural deficits. There was strong evidence of spatial correspondence across modalities: For all four components, the impact of the respective component on gray matter at a region strongly predicted the impact on functional connectivity at that region. Overall, our results demonstrate that {ADHD} involves multiple, cohesive modality spanning deficits, each one of which exhibits strong spatial overlap in the pattern of structural and functional alterations.},

	abstract = {Background

Recent studies suggest that mindfulness may be an effective component for posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) treatment. Mindfulness involves practice in volitional shifting of attention from ``mind wandering'' to present-moment attention to sensations, and cultivating acceptance. We examined potential neural correlates of mindfulness training using a novel group therapy (mindfulness-based exposure therapy ({MBET})) in combat veterans with {PTSD} deployed to Afghanistan ({OEF}) and/or Iraq ({OIF}).


Methods

Twenty-three male {OEF}/{OIF} combat veterans with {PTSD} were treated with a mindfulness-based intervention (N = 14) or an active control group therapy (present-centered group therapy ({PCGT}), N = 9). Pre-post therapy functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}, 3 T) examined resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) in default mode network ({DMN}) using posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) seeds, and salience network ({SN}) with anatomical amygdala seeds. {PTSD} symptoms were assessed at pre- and posttherapy with Clinician Administered {PTSD} Scale ({CAPS}).


Results

Patients treated with {MBET} had reduced {PTSD} symptoms (effect size d = 0.92) but effect was not significantly different from {PCGT} (d = 0.46). Increased {DMN} {rsFC} ({PCC} seed) with dorsolateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) regions and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) regions associated with executive control was seen following {MBET}. A group × time interaction found {MBET} showed increased connectivity with {DLPFC} and dorsal {ACC} following therapy; {PCC}{DLPFC} connectivity was correlated with improvement in {PTSD} avoidant and hyperarousal symptoms.


Conclusions

Increased connectivity between {DMN} and executive control regions following mindfulness training could underlie increased capacity for volitional shifting of attention. The increased {PCC}{DLPFC} {rsFC} following {MBET} was related to {PTSD} symptom improvement, pointing to a potential therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness-based therapies.},

Intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), important units of brain functional organization, demonstrate substantial maturation during youth. In addition, interrelationships between {ICNs} have been reliably implicated in attention performance. It is unknown whether alterations in {ICN} maturational profiles can reliably detect impaired attention functioning in youth.Objective
To use a network growth charting approach to investigate the association between alterations in {ICN} maturation and attention performance.Design, Setting, and Participants
Data were obtained from the publicly available Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, a prospective, population-based sample of 9498 youths who underwent genomic testing, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging. Data collection was conducted at an academic and children's hospital health care network between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2011, and data analysis was conducted between February 1, 2015, and January 15, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures
Statistical associations between deviations from normative network growth were assessed as well as 2 main outcome measures: accuracy during the Penn Continuous Performance Test and diagnosis with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Results
Of the 9498 individuals identified, 1000 youths aged 8 to 22 years underwent brain imaging. A sample of 519 youths who met quality control criteria entered analysis, of whom 25 (4.8\%) met criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The mean ({SD}) age of the youth was 15.7 (3.1) years, and 223 (43.0\%) were male. Participants' patterns of deviations from normative maturational trajectories were indicative of sustained attention functioning (R2?=?24\%; F6,512?=?26.89; P?{\textless}?2.2?×?10-16). Moreover, these patterns were found to be a reliable biomarker of severe attention impairment (peak receiver operating characteristic curve measured by area under the curve, 79.3\%). In particular, a down-shifted pattern of {ICN} maturation (shallow maturation), rather than a right-shifted pattern (lagged maturation), was implicated in reduced attention performance (Akaike information criterion relative likelihood, 3.22?×?1026). Finally, parallel associations between {ICN} dysmaturation and diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were identified.Conclusions and Relevance
Growth charting methods are widely used to assess the development of physical or other biometric characteristics, such as weight and head circumference. To date, this is the first demonstration that this method can be extended to development of functional brain networks to identify clinically relevant conditions, such as dysfunction of sustained attention.},

	abstract = {Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to a strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome (defined by pairs of points in 3-D space) is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the {GraphNet} regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or {GraphNet} regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine ({SVM}) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and {GraphNet} regularized {SVM} with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D ``connectome space,'' offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes.},

Although evidence is ambiguous, behavioural studies have repeatedly suggested that control-demanding tasks seem to deplete a limited cache of self-regulatory resources leading to performance degradations and fatigue. While resource depletion has indirectly been associated with a decline in right prefrontal cortex capacity, its precise neural underpinnings have not yet been revealed. This study consisted of two independent experiments, which set out to investigate the causal role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) in a classic dual phase depletion paradigm employing non-invasive brain stimulation. In Experiment 1 we demonstrated a general depletion effect, which was significantly eliminated by anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the right {DLPFC}. In Experiment 2, however, we failed to replicate the basic psychological depletion effect within a second independent sample. The dissimilar results are discussed in the context of the current replication crisis' and suggestions for future studies are offered. While our current results do not allow us to firmly argue for or against the existence of resource depletion, we outline why it is crucial to further clarify which specific external and internal circumstances lead to limited replicability of the described effect.

Mothers reported on psychological control. Children's cortisol was collected during a stressor and two indices of Area Under the Curve ({AUC}) were computed: {AUCg} which accounts for total output, and {AUCi}, which captures reactivity. Results indicate that Chinese mothers reported higher levels of psychological control and Chinese children had higher levels of {AUCg} than their American counterparts. Across both cultures, psychological control was significantly associated with increased cortisol levels as indexed by {AUCg}. There were no associations for {AUCi}. Finally, mediation analyses demonstrated that psychological control fully explained cultural differences in children's cortisol stress response as indexed by {AUCg}.},

	abstract = {Purpose
We combined a large longitudinal neuroimaging dataset that includes children who do and do not stutter and a whole-brain network analysis in order to examine the intra- and inter-network connectivity changes associated with stuttering. Additionally, we asked whether whole brain connectivity patterns observed at the initial year of scanning could predict persistent stuttering in later years.
Methods
A total of 224 high-quality resting state {fMRI} scans collected from 84 children (42 stuttering, 42 controls) were entered into an independent component analysis ({ICA}), yielding a number of distinct network connectivity maps (``components'') as well as expression scores for each component that quantified the degree to which it is expressed for each child. These expression scores were compared between stuttering and control groups' first scans. In a second analysis, we examined whether the components that were most predictive of stuttering status also predicted persistence in stuttering.
Results
Stuttering status, as well as stuttering persistence, were associated with aberrant network connectivity involving the default mode network and its connectivity with attention, somatomotor, and frontoparietal networks. The results suggest developmental alterations in the balance of integration and segregation of large-scale neural networks that support proficient task performance including fluent speech motor control.
Conclusions
This study supports the view that stuttering is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder and provides comprehensive brain network maps that substantiate past theories emphasizing the importance of considering situational, emotional, attentional and linguistic factors in explaining the basis for stuttering onset, persistence, and recovery.},

	title = {Disease Prediction based on Functional Connectomes using a Scalable and Spatially-Informed Support Vector Machine},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5415},
	abstract = {Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the {GraphNet} regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or {GraphNet} regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine ({SVM}) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and {GraphNet} regularized {SVM} with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D "connectome space," offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes.},

	abstract = {While statistical analysis of a single network has received a lot of attention in recent years, with a focus on social networks, analysis of a sample of networks presents its own challenges which require a different set of analytic tools. Here we study the problem of classification of networks with labeled nodes, motivated by applications in neuroimaging. Brain networks are constructed from imaging data to represent functional connectivity between regions of the brain, and previous work has shown the potential of such networks to distinguish between various brain disorders, giving rise to a network (or graph) classification problem. Existing approaches to graph classification tend to either treat all edge weights as a long vector, ignoring the network structure, or focus on the graph topology while ignoring the edge weights. Our goal here is to design a graph classification method that uses both the individual edge information and the network structure of the data in a computationally efficient way. We are also interested in obtaining a parsimonious and interpretable representation of differences in brain connectivity patterns between classes, which requires variable selection. We propose a graph classification method that uses edge weights as variables but incorporates the network nature of the data via penalties that promotes sparsity in the number of nodes. We implement the method via efficient convex optimization algorithms and show good performance on data from two {fMRI} studies of schizophrenia.},

It is an open question, however, whether connectomes differ across individuals in a correspondingly massive number of ways, or whether most differences take a small number of characteristic forms. We systematically investigated this question and found clear evidence of low-rank structure in which a modest number of connectomic components, around 50-150, account for a sizable portion of inter-individual connectomic variation. This number was convergently arrived at with multiple methods including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and assessment of reconstruction of out-of-sample data. We demonstrate that these connectomic components enable prediction of a broad array of neurocognitive and clinical variables. In addition, using stochastic block modeling-based methods, we show these components exhibit extensive community structure reflecting interrelationships between intrinsic connectivity networks. We propose that these connectivity components form an effective basis set for quantifying and interpreting inter-individual connectomic differences, and for predicting behavioral/clinical phenotypes.},

	title = {Circadian Cortisol and Child Mood in China and the United States},
	url = {http://www.srcd.org/},
	abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis regulates cortisol response to stress and its circadian pattern (Lopez 2004). Both {HPA} functions have been of interest to developmental researchers who wish to understand the biological underpinnings of emotion regulation. The circadian pattern of cortisol is initially established in infancy. However, it matures into the preschool years becoming more reliable by age 4 (Watamura 2004). Variations in the circadian cortisol pattern have been observed in older children and adolescents with mental health concerns (Pajer 2001, {McBurnett} 2000, Cicchetti 2001, Heim 2000).  In addition, altered circadian cortisol patterns have been observed in younger at-risk children in foster care, with blunted patterns at preschool age (Dozier 2006). Blunted patterns may result from lower morning or elevated evening levels or both.  Few studies have investigated relationships between circadian cortisol patterns and aspects of emotion regulation in normative populations of young children and fewer have examined cultural differences in such relationships.
As part of a larger study of emotion regulation in preschool-age children, 110 subjects were enrolled across two urban sites in the {US} and China. Saliva was collected within 45 minutes of awakening and bedtime over the course of three days for measurement of cortisol. Average cortisol concentrations and standard deviation across three days were computed separately for morning and evening samples. Differences between {AM}/{PM} pairs were summed across the three days. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist ({CBCL}) (Achenbach, 1997) and the Child Mood Survey ({CMS}, based on the Mood Survey Questionnaire, Froming 1980).  {CBCL} internalizing and externalizing scales, {CMS} mood level and reactivity scales and three {CMS} items were included: Valence (how happy the child is); Emotional Lability (how frequently the child's mood changes), Reactive Intensity (how intensely the child reacts).  Differences by culture were examined with one-way {ANOVA}; relationships between variables within culture were examined with bivariate correlations.  
Chinese participants had higher morning cortisol concentrations and greater variability in their evening samples than {US} subjects. Evening cortisol concentrations and morning variability did not differ by culture.   
Chinese mothers reported greater child lability and intensity than {US} parents. {CMS} reactivity and mood level scales were both higher for Chinese children. Chinese mothers also reported higher scores for {CBCL} internalizing and externalizing scales. Mother report of child valence did not differ by culture.
Emotional lability was related to morning cortisol variability and evening cortisol concentrations in China and to morning cortisol concentration and evening cortisol variability in the {US}. Reactive intensity was related to both morning cortisol concentrations and variability in China, but not in the {US}.  Additionally, {CMS} reactivity scale was related to morning cortisol concentrations in China but not in the {US}. There were no associations between cortisol measures and valence, {CMS} level scale and {CBCL} internalizing or externalizing scales.
The lack of association between cortisol measures and mood level is notable given their relationships to emotional reactivity measures in this normative preschool-age sample. Further research is necessary to understand the relationships between cortisol level and variability and mood in young children and the role of culture in these relationships.},

@unpublished{kessler_dynamic_2009,
	location = {Shanghai, China},
	title = {Dynamic Demonstration of Early Language Understanding in Chinese- and English-learning Infants},
	url = {www.icdl09.org},
	abstract = {Background: Children's language learning is often measured using discrete, single outcome measures that collapse time-series data into a single measurement, potentially missing patterns evident only through time. Our data suggests that demonstrations of linguistic knowledge vary not only across languages, word class (noun/verb), and morphological frame (e.g. kick vs kicking), but also across micro-units of time as evidenced through online, dynamic looking times.

Procedure: Young children's comprehension of familiar words was examined through a paradigm based on the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm ({IPLP}). Children were familiarized to an actor character, ``Po,'' in an initial play session, and then participated in the testing session. Dynamic scenes, depicting ``Po'' performing an action on an object, were presented with a simultaneous audio stimulus, matching either the action or the object. The audio was either presented with or without morphological inflections (e.g., kissing vs. kiss). The dynamic scene was then split into two scenes depicted at either side of the presentation monitor. In one scene, the object was the same but the action was different, and in the other the action was the same but the object was different. The same audio as before was played. The side where the audio matched the scene was designated ``Target'' and the side where the audio did not match was called ``Non-Target.'' This was repeated for four different possible action-object pairings. The two broken up scenes were presented without audio at the beginning of the trial to allow for evaluation of differential salience of the two depictions. All presentations were interceded by a simple attention getter that drew the child's attention to the center of the presentation monitor.

Participants: 12, 15, 18, and 24 month old infants learning English or Chinese were tested in Ann Arbor, {MI}, {USA}, or Beijing, China.

Measures: Infant-caregivers reported in advance whether their child could understand or say any of the words used in the audio. Participants were videotaped during the {IPLP} session and their directional looking (left, center, right, away) was coded for each frame of video.

Analysis: Participants were grouped according to language, morphological frame, and then subdivided based on either age or knowledge of a given word. We were interested in visualizing the patterns of target versus non-target looking over time to explore differences in the patterns resulting from effects of and interactions between age, word knowledge, target word type, language, and morphological frame. For each child, each frame of each test trial was scored as either 1 (target-looking) or 0 (not target-looking). Children's trials were converted to a word-onset locked millisecond timeline and concatenated into analytical subgroups by averaging. The result is a number from 0 to 1 that represents the proportion of children within a given group looking at the target side for each frame. This proportion is plotted against time for visual inspection.

Results: The resulting data visualization highlights the discovery of an interplay between language, morphological frame, word knowledge, and class. For example, for the target word ``Bottle,'' in the English Bare condition, children who can say the word do not demonstrate greater understanding (as would be evidenced by a higher proportion of target-looking early in the trial), but a benefit appears with a morphological frame (``a bottle'') whereby a higher proportion of children who can say the word look at the target side early in the trial relative to children who are not reported to say the word. In Mandarin, despite receiving a bare morphological frame, participants with productive knowledge of the word have a clear advantage similar to the English Morph condition. Despite these differences, parent report of ``bottle'' production does not differ by language (English=18/45; Chinese=8/23).

Conclusion: Our analysis suggests a complex interplay between morphological frame, language, word class (noun/verb), and word knowledge in the patterns of demonstration of word knowledge.},

	abstract = {Abstract: This research demonstrates that Chinese and American preschoolers show similar salivary cortisol response patterns to challenging emotional tasks. Factors such as parent and child baseline salivary cortisol levels and maternal report of child emotional reactivity do not differ across cultures. 
Supporting Summary: Background: there has been little research examining the cross-cultural differences of preschoolers' behavioral and physiological responses to challenging emotional situations. This study is part of a larger research project on the development of emotion regulation in four-year-olds in China, Japan, and the United States. Our data investigates cross-cultural differences in salivary cortisol responses to disappointing and frustrating tasks among preschoolers in the United States and China. Additionally, these data examine maternal report of child emotional reactivity and the relationship between maternal report and child salivary cortisol levels. 
Design: participants were 25 four-year-olds from China (China, n=12) and the United States ({US}, n=13). The study was conducted at each child's preschool for three consecutive days in two hour blocks. Saliva was collected at the start of each session and was followed by a 30-minute calming activity. After the calming activity, saliva was collected immediately prior to a challenging emotional activity and subsequently in 10-minute intervals for the remaining 90 minutes. The challenging tasks were a control task (day 1), a frustrating task, and a disappointing task (counterbalanced on days 2-3). Prior to the start of the study, mothers completed a child version of the Mood Survey questionnaire (Froming \& Underwood, 1980) and the Child Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart, 1989). In addition, parent and child saliva was collected at home in the morning and evening of each day of the study. 
Analysis: salivary cortisol concentrations were determined by {ELISA}. Pearson correlations and {ANOVA} tests were used to explore similarities and differences across the cultures. Specifically, we examined the relationship between salivary cortisol reactivity and maternal report of emotional reactivity. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between parent cortisol baseline levels and child cortisol reactivity. Salivary cortisol reactivity was determined by averaging individual differences between peak and baseline cortisol levels. This average was then split across the mean for each culture. Children whose average difference between peak and baseline cortisol levels (across three days of testing) was greater than the corresponding cultural mean were classified as highly responsive. Emotional reactivity was determined by using scores on the anger and frustration subscale on the {CBQ} and the reactivity subscale on the child Mood Survey. 
Results: mean cortisol level differed across each culture (C=.051 nmol/L; {US}=.018 nmol/L). It should be noted that Chinese children had, on average, higher morning cortisol levels than {US} children. Based on the separate reactivity categorization (high/low) by culture, {ANOVA} tests revealed that there were no significant differences in reactivity across the two cultures. In addition, maternal report of child emotional reactivity was not related to child reactivity as measured by changes in salivary cortisol levels. There were no significant differences in maternal report of child emotional reactivity across cultures. Also, parent morning and evening cortisol levels were not related to child cortisol response during the testing period across cultures. 
Conclusion: there were no significant cross-cultural differences in measures of behavioral and physiological response to challenging emotional situations. This suggests that child emotionality across cultures is more similar than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopment disorder with extensive evidence of neural disconnection. In order to further characterize connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia, we applied a novel whole-brain connectomic approach to 145 resting state scans from the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence sample.
Methods: 71 patients with schizophrenia ({SZ}) and 74 healthy controls ({HC}) underwent 6-minute resting scans. After standard pre-processing, 1166 {ROIs} were placed at 12mm intervals across the brain, and cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced. These were thresholded and overlaid on the Yeo (2012) network parcellation of the resting brain to implicate seven major resting state networks, and five additional subcortical regions (see Figure). Cross-tabulations between networks were compared to a null distribution with difference of proportion Z-tests in order to identify deviant intra- and inter-network connectivity in {SZ} versus {HC}. Motion regressors at the first and second-levels quantified and minimized motion effects.
Results: {SZ} brains exhibited diffuse hypoconnectivity within the default network (Z=4.01, p{\textless}0.001), and between hippocampus/parahippocampus and default and attention networks (Z=7.06, p{\textless}0.001). Hyperconnectivity was observed within frontoparietal networks (Z=3.41, p{\textless}0.001), and between other task-positive networks, including dorsal attention, ventral attention, and somatomotor network (ps{\textless}0.001; see Figure).
Conclusions: Using novel, whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide evidence of robust, distributed connectivity abnormalities in default, attention, and limbic networks in schizophrenia that could potentially serve as reliable biomarkers of disease.},

	abstract = {Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant medication that reliably produces acute improvements in attention functioning. Recent models of attention focus on interconnectivity between large-scale networks, especially default network and task positive networks. However, the effects of methylphenidate in altering network connectivity patterns are poorly understood. We conducted a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study, in which 32 healthy volunteers received either methylphenidate or placebo prior to two {fMRI} scans separated by approximately one week. We report the results of three analyses of data generated from this study. Analysis 1 used paired support-vector machines, a multivariate classification method for within-subject data developed by our group, applied to resting state scans. We demonstrate methylphenidate produces a reliably detected multivariate neurosignature. In particular, methylphenidate generates altered default network-task positive network coupling, and altered connectivity within visual and somatomotor networks. Analysis 2 used network contingency analysis, a novel connectomic analysis method developed by our group, to identify network relationship patterns that predict across session changes in reaction time variability. Analysis 3 introduces dynamic connectivity, a new method for investigating changes in network coupling patterns over short time intervals (e.g., 15-60 seconds) within a scanning session. We demonstrate that changes in dynamic connectivity between large-scale networks predict changes in reaction time variability across short temporal epochs within a single scan.},

	abstract = {Background: A prominent neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that {ADHD} involves a lag in brain maturation. In order to investigate this hypothesis simultaneously across both brain structure and function, we used joint independent components analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. We hypothesized that components associated with large-scale networks [in particular default mode network ({DMN}) and task positive network ({TPNs})] and regions involved in cognitive and motoric regulation would exhibit both strong maturational effects and strong opposing {ADHD} effects.

Methods: For 421 participants from the {ADHD}-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes derived from 1166 regions of interest throughout the brain. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression as a function of disease and age.

Results: Two components significantly showed the predicted pattern of age effects that were lagged in individuals with {ADHD}. The first component showed (with increasing age) increased 1) intra {DMN} integration; 2) increased segregation between {DMN} and dorsal and ventral attention networks (two {TPNs}); and 3) increased gray matter volume in {TPN} regions responsible for regulatory control and decreases in striatal regions. The second had diffuse connectomic alterations and gray matter changes similar to the first. 

Conclusions: We observed modality-spanning maturational lag in {ADHD}, specifically in the development of {DMN} interrelationships with attention networks. Our findings may shed light on the developmental etiology of {ADHD}.},

either the {GraphNet}, fused Lasso, or the isotropic total variation penalty,
and (2) the inter-site structure captured via the multitask ` 1 ` 2 -penalty.
To solve the resulting high dimensional optimization problem, we intro-

	abstract = {Background  
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a serious and prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging investigations of {ADHD} have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions associated with motor inhibition and cognitive control. Recent years have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in {ADHD}, with current work focusing on abnormal relationships between default network and task positive attention networks. In order to comprehensively characterize connectivity abnormalities in {ADHD} across the whole brain, we applied network contingency analysis, a novel connectomic approach developed by our group, to the {ADHD}-200 multisite sample.

Methods: 632 participants (419 {HC}, 212 {ADHD}) from seven contributing sites underwent resting state scanning. Quality checking removed outliers and subjects with excessive motion, leaving 421 participants to enter analysis (288 {HC}, mean age 12.8; 133 {ADHD}; mean age 12.0). After standard pre-processing, 1166 {ROIs} were placed at 12mm intervals across the brain, and cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced for each subject. {ADHD} and {HC} connectomes were subtracted producing a difference map, with model covariates controlling for the effects of scanner/site, age, {IQ}, handedness, and head motion. For seven major connectivity networks identified in the Yeo (2012) parcellation, deviant intra- and inter-network connectivity was identified with non-parametric permutation tests, with {FDR}-correction applied to account for multiple comparisons.

Results 
{ADHD} brains exhibited diffuse hypoconnectivity within the default network ({FDR} q=0.03). In addition, default network exhibited aberrant connectivity with two task positive networksfrontoparietal network (q=0.008) and ventral attention network (q{\textless}0.001)as well as visual network (q=0.04). Significant right lateralization was observed in abnormal connections within default network (p{\textless}0.001; Bernoulli test), and default network connections with task positive and visual networks (all ps {\textless}0.01).

Conclusion  
Using novel whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide evidence of robust, distributed connectivity abnormalities in {ADHD}. Consistent with current models, prominent disturbances were identified in connections within default network and between default network and task-positive networks. Right lateralization of default network abnormalities in {ADHD} was an unexpected finding, but is consistent with emerging evidence of right-brain dominance in visuospatial attention. Distributed abnormalities in the {ADHD} resting state connectome could potentially serve as a brain-based biomarker of the disease.},

	title = {Growth Charting of Brain Connectivity Networks and the Identification of Attention Impairment in Youth},
	abstract = {Background
Growth charts of physical characteristics (e.g., pediatric growth charts of height \& head circumference) have long been used for early identification of somatic abnormalities. In the present study, we developed growth charts for maturing functional brain networks in order to identify clinically-relevant neurocognitive abnormalities, in particular impairments in attention functioning. The human brain is organized into a number of interconnected units called intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), and {ICNs} exhibit extensive development and differentiation during youth. In addition, {ICNs} are also implicated in attention performance. These observations raise an intriguing hypothesis: Deviations from neurotypical patterns of network maturation, calculated by means of network growth charts, could reliably predict the early emergence of sustained attention impairment. This study is, as far as we know, the first to investigate this hypothesis. 


Methods
Resting state functional neuroimaging scans were obtained for 519 youth, age 8-22. These scans were used to produce comprehensive maps of functional connectivity across the whole brain (``functional connectomes''). All participants also performed the Penn Continuous Performance Test, which evaluates sustained attention functioning. Using a multivariate statistical method (joint independent component analyses) we produced growth charts that represent neurotypical patterns of maturation for major brain networks. ``Underdevelopment scores'' were then calculated reflecting each participant's deviations from neurotypical growth. These scores were used to predict attention dysfunction (as measured by the Penn Continuous Performance Task).

Results
Several key networks showed evidence of robust maturation including default mode network and several task-positive networks, which have previously been implicated in attention functioning. After constructing growth charts for these networks, we found that underdevelopment scores (i.e., scores reflecting underdevelopment of networks relative to age) predicted a remarkable 28.7\% of the variance across participants in attention functioning (F(15,503) = 13.48, p {\textless} 2.2 * 10{\textasciicircum}(-16))). Moreover, they served as a reliable biomarker of severe attention impairment (79.3\% prediction accuracy). 

Conclusions
This study introduces a novel brain network growth charting method which we used to produce a highly sensitive brain-based biomarker of attention dysfunction. Growth charting of functional brain networks could provide a new approach for constructing neuroimaging biomarkers for other psychiatrically relevant conditions. Extensions of this methodology for biomarker construction for psychosis- and autism-spectrum traits are underway.




Using this technique, we showed children who perform substantially worse in objective tests of attention performance are underedeveloped with respect to key brain networks implicated in attention functioning perform substantially worse in objective tests of attention performance. produced a highly sensitive brain-based biomarker of attention dysfunction by growth charting brain networks implicated in both developmental and attention literature. We believe this approach holds great promise for biomarker discovery in other developmentally emergent cognitive domains.},

	abstract = {Racial disparities in police use of force, in particular fatal shootings, are a frequent topic of discussion and controversy and have given rise to both movements (e.g. \#{BlackLivesMatter}) and countermovements. Recently, there has been academic interest in bringing a quantitative lens to bear to peel back the layers and approximate extant disparities.

In a particularly influential paper, Cody Ross used a multi-level Bayesian approach, implemented in the popular Bayesian modeling framework Stan, to arrive at both national- and county-level estimates. His work also explores the role of a number of regionally varying covariates in predicting relative risks.

Dan and his colleagues became interested in the work, and thanks to the code and data for the paper being publicly available, were able to first reproduce many of the key results, and then replicate several using an independent dataset covering another time period collected by the Washington Post.

They're currently extending the approach to better capture instances of persistent racial disparity in police shooting to highlight potential regional targets for further study (both troubling cases and "success stories").

This is an evolving, live project, and you can follow along leading up to and after the presentation at github.},

Abstract:
Background:
Attention functioning rapidly matures in childhood and adolescence. Intrinsic connectivity networks ({ICNs}), convergently implicated in attentional processing, also demonstrate massive maturation during this time. We applied joint independent component analysis ({jICA}), a powerful multivariate method, to a large youth sample to test the hypothesis that {ICN} organization explains developmental improvement in attention functioning and individual differences in task performance.
Methods:
Participants (n=671, ages 8.6-22.6) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort completed the Penn Continuous Performance Task and 6.2-minute resting state scans. Cross-correlation matrices (connectomes') were produced from 1068 {ROIs} and submitted to {jICA}. The resulting connectomic components were tested for differential expression as a function of age and task accuracy. Motion effects were controlled with scrubbing and first- and second-level motion regression.
Results:
Expression of the fifteen connectomic components accounted for a remarkable 33\% of the variance in task performance (F(15,655)=21.52; p=2.2x10{\textasciicircum}-16). Further probing showed that six components that exhibited highly statistically significant maturational effects (all p's{\textless}0.01, {FDR}-corrected) by themselves accounted for most of the predictive power (27\% of variance in task performance), and continued to significantly predict task performance even after controlling for chronological age (F(6,662)=12.7, p=1.2x10{\textasciicircum}-13). These six components implicate connectomic alterations within the default mode network ({DMN}), within the frontoparietal network ({FPN}), and between the {DMN} and two task positive networks, the Ventral Attention Network and Dorsal Attention Network. 
Conclusions:
Using whole-brain connectomic methods, we provide first-time evidence that maturation of the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is a robust predictor of attention performance. These results suggest that dysmaturation of {ICNs} could serve as a biomarker of attention dysfunction.},

This research suggests that parents of Chinese and American preschoolers differ in marital conflict, ambivalence, and relationship maintenance attitudes but not in marital love. Parent's marital health is a good predictor for preschooler's physiological reactivity under stressful circumstances even when controlling for other theoretically-linked factors (such as parent-reported child reactivity).},

By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as modularity over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

The lasso, the {LARS} algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems.

That in turn yields a notion of ergodicity. Sampling algorithms induce model classes---graphon models, sparse generalizations of exchangeable graphs, and random multigraphs with exchangeable edges can all be obtained in this manner, and we specialize our results to a number of examples. One class of sampling algorithms emerges as special: Roughly speaking, those defined as limits of random transformations drawn uniformly from certain sequences of groups.

Real-world complex systems may be mathematically modeled as graphs, revealing properties of the system. Here we study graphs of functional brain organization in healthy adults using resting state functional connectivity {MRI}. We propose two novel brain-wide graphs, one of 264 putative functional areas, the other a modification of voxelwise networks that eliminates potentially artificial short-distance relationships. These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a processing system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.

By finding such groups of vertices with similar structural roles, we extract a compact representation of the network's large-scale structure, which can facilitate its scientific interpretation and the prediction of unknown or future interactions. Popular approaches, including the stochastic block model, assume edges are unweighted, which limits their utility by throwing away potentially useful information. We introduce the `weighted stochastic block model' (WSBM), which generalizes the stochastic block model to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential family distribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges, allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weights are discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm for efficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent block structures. We then evaluate the WSBM's performance on both edge-existence and edge-weight prediction tasks for a set of real-world weighted networks. In all cases, the WSBM performs as well or better than the best alternatives on these tasks.},

	abstract = {We generalize the stochastic block model to the important case in which edges are annotated with weights drawn from an exponential family distribution. This generalization introduces several technical difficulties for model estimation, which we solve using a Bayesian approach. We introduce a variational algorithm that efficiently approximates the model's posterior distribution for dense graphs. In specific numerical experiments on edge-weighted networks, this weighted stochastic block model outperforms the common approach of first applying a single threshold to all weights and then applying the classic stochastic block model, which can obscure latent block structure in networks. This model will enable the recovery of latent structure in a broader range of network data than was previously possible.},

	abstract = {a posteriori blockmodeling for graphs is proposed. The model assumes that the vertices of the graph are partitioned into two unknown blocks and that the probability of an edge between two vertices depends only on the blocks to which they belong. Statistical procedures are derived for estimating the probabilities of edges and for predicting the block structure from observations of the edge pattern only. ML estimators can be computed using the EM algorithm, but this strategy is practical only for small graphs. A Bayesian estimator, based on the Gibbs sampling, is proposed. This estimator is practical also for large graphs. When ML estimators are used, the block structure can be predicted based on predictive likelihood. When Gibbs sampling is used, the block structure can be predicted from posterior predictive probabilities. A side result is that when the number of vertices tends to infinity while the probabilities remain constant, the block structure can be recovered correctly with probability tending to 1.},
